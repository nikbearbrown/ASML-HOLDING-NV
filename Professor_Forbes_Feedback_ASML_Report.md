### 1.4 Stock Price Analysis and Recent Decline

Despite ASML's strong market position and financial performance, the company's stock has experienced a significant decline of approximately 26% in the past 21 months. As of June 2025, ASML stock was trading at approximately $747 per share, down from its all-time high of around $1,110 reached in July 2024. This represents a substantial correction that warrants investigation.

Several factors have contributed to this decline:

1. **Muted Guidance and Order Slowdown**: ASML provided conservative guidance for 2025, projecting weaker order intake due to sluggish recoveries in mobile and PC markets. In Q3 2024, net system bookings fell to just $2.6 billion, a significant decrease from $8.9 billion and $6.3 billion in previous quarters.

2. **High-NA EUV Transition Costs**: The company's transition to more advanced High-NA EUV systems has created short-term margin pressures. In Q3 2024, ASML reported a 3.5% margin dilution related to ramp-up costs for these systems.

3. **Geopolitical Tensions**: Escalating export restrictions affecting China, which accounts for over 36% of ASML's revenue, have created uncertainty. The Dutch government has implemented additional export controls on certain ASML chipmaking equipment to China, aligning with U.S. policy.

4. **Customer Delays**: Major customers like Samsung have delayed equipment shipments for new fabrication facilities, including the $17 billion plant in Taylor, Texas. These delays reflect a more cautious approach to capacity expansion amid economic uncertainty.

5. **Premium Valuation Concerns**: Despite the decline, ASML still trades at a forward P/E multiple of approximately 28.17x, which exceeds the industry average of 27.86x, raising concerns about valuation in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

Nevertheless, ASML maintains a substantial order backlog of €36 billion (as of December 2024), representing approximately 1.3 times its annual revenue, which provides a buffer against short-term demand fluctuations.

### 1.5 Workforce and Organizational Structure

As of December 31, 2024, ASML employed:
- **Total employees (headcount)**: 43,395
- **Full-time equivalents (FTEs)**: 44,027
  - Payroll employees: 42,786 FTEs
  - Temporary employees: 1,241 FTEs

Workforce distribution:
- By geography:
  - Netherlands: 23,194 employees (53.4%)
  - United States: 8,310 employees (19.2%)
  - Taiwan: 4,572 employees (10.5%)
  - Other locations: 7,319 employees (16.9%)
- By function:
  - Research & Development: 15,992 FTEs (36.3%)
